üõ†Ô∏è CI/CD with Jenkins: Project Summary & What I Learned
‚úÖ Objective:
The goal of this project was to automate a Jenkins build process using GitHub webhooks. This ensures that whenever a change is pushed to a GitHub repository, Jenkins will automatically trigger a build ‚Äî a key concept in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

üîÅ Step-by-Step Process:
Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
I created a GitHub repository called jenkins-scm and added a README.md file to initialize it.

Step 2: Create a Jenkins Job
Logged into my Jenkins dashboard.

Created a freestyle project named my-first-job.

Step 3: Connect Jenkins to GitHub (SCM Integration)
Inside the job configuration, I went to Source Code Management and selected Git.

Pasted my GitHub repository URL.

Ensured the branch to build was set to main.

Clicked ‚ÄúBuild Now‚Äù to test the connection ‚Äî Jenkins successfully pulled the repository.

Step 4: Configure Build Trigger
In the Build Triggers section, I selected "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling".

This allows Jenkins to build automatically when a change is pushed to GitHub.

Step 5: Create a GitHub Webhook
Navigated to Settings > Webhooks in my GitHub repository.

Added a new webhook pointing to:

perl
Copy
Edit
http://<my-jenkins-ip>:8080/github-webhook/
Selected application/json as the content type.

Enabled it for push events.

Saved the webhook.

Step 6: Test the Integration
Made a small change in the README.md file on GitHub and committed it.

This triggered a webhook call to Jenkins.

Jenkins automatically started a new build ‚Äî confirming the automation worked.

üí° What I Learned:
How to integrate GitHub with Jenkins using SCM configuration.

The importance of webhooks in CI/CD workflows.

How to automate builds using Jenkins build triggers.

The role of freestyle projects in Jenkins for building/testing small jobs.

Learned that Jenkins must be publicly accessible for GitHub webhook to work ‚Äî and if it's not, you can use ngrok or deploy Jenkins on a cloud instance.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
Since my Jenkins server was hosted locally and not publicly accessible, I created the webhook correctly but simulated the automation by manually triggering a build after pushing changes to GitHub. In a real-world scenario, I would use a service like ngrok or deploy Jenkins to a cloud provider.
